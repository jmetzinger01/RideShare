Ride Share Analysis

Overview of Analysis
The new analysis looks at how the total fares for each type of city changes over time, specifically January through April.

Results
The urban city type has the most use of rides compared to the other types.  However, the average fare and fare by driver are the lowest in the urban areas and highest in the rural areas.  The total fares for each type of city changes over time without a common theme. There does not seem to be any correlation between the rise/fall of total fares in each city type by time of year; except one week in February, where all 3 city types had a peak of the sum of fares.

Summary
It is suggested to find the determining factor for the week of February where all 3 city types peaked in fares.  
It is suggested to analyze the time of the rural fares to determine overlap and the need for multiple drivers.  The less overlap, the less drivers needed to be employed at one time.
